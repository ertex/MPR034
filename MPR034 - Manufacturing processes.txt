How did the 1st industrial revolution change manufacturing	It made large amounts of products avalible at a low cost.
What are the major aspects of industry 4.0	<b>Connectivity, </b>The factory is connected both to itself and other factories. The buzzword calls it IoT<br><br><b>Adaptivness, </b>The factory is no longer a ridgid structure that makes one part. The factory should be flexible to create many different parts.<div><br></div><div><b>The human, </b>The factory depends on the human either via control of the systems or as a flexible tool, The humans abilities can be enhanced via wearables, augmented reality etc.<br><br>(Add more here)</div><div><br></div><div><b>Why do we want Industry 4.0?</b><br>Let's say you have a faliure in a camshaft in a truck. You can now see on what day that camshaft was manufatured, how the conditions of the part differed to other parts. The data is there. Failure analisys has gotten more effective and more durable parts and ridgid manufacturing can be achived.<br><br>'Old' industry uses a push strategy, they make one highly optimised product and sell it through a push strategy. A flexible industry can have a custom product were you can change the color, shape of a handle etc. This adds value to the customer and the product can be sold at a higher price.</div>
Define manufacturing in terms of technology and economics	<b>Technology perspecive.<br></b>Application of physical process to alter the geometry, properties and/or the apperance of a starting material to make a parts or products.<br><br>Your material enters the process and using Machines, Tools, Power, Labor you generate parts and waste.<div><br></div><div><b>Economic perspective</b></div><div>Transformation of material into items of greater value by one or more processing and/or assembly operations.<br><br>Your Process is applied to a material, and the value of that part is increesed.</div>
Breifly define quality and quantity in terms of manufaturing.	<b>Quality </b>is about how well made a product is made, and how much of it that is well made.<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Design quality </b>is about giving customers what they would like</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Production quality</b>&nbsp;is <b>not</b> about giving customers what they would <b>not</b> like</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Quantity&nbsp;</b>is about how much is produced, when it is produced and what resources are required to produce it.</div>
What is the difference between repeatablility and precistion?	<b>Precision </b>is how close the mean value is to the nominal value, a high precistion is when the nominal is 2mm and you make it 2mm +-1mm but low repeatability.<br><br><b>Repeatablility </b>is how big the deviation is between parts, if the nominal &nbsp;value is 2mm and you get 3mm +-0.05mm you have a high repeatablity, but low precistion
Name some reasons why surfaces are important.	They are Aesthetic<br><br>Surfaces affect safety, eg, non-slip surfaces<br><br>Friction and wear depend on surface characteristics. The surface can have tension buildup and/or cracks leading to premature failure.<br><br>Surfaces affect mechanical and physical properties, eg engineered non-stick surfaces&nbsp;<br><br>Assembly of parts is affected by their surface.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Smooth surfaces make better contacts.</div>
Eleborate on the different categories of surface integrity and what are its potential effects on functional performance.	<b>Surface intregity </b>is a collection of properties like, <b>texture, Microstructure, hardness, cracks, Chemical condition, residual stress.</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Functional properties </b>is also a collection like, <b>Tensile/fatigue strength</b>, <b>Contact strength, Rolling contact strength</b>, <b>wear resistance, corrosion recistance.</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Starting with <b>fautigue</b>, a repeated force can leave room for cracks to form/grow, if a <b>crack</b> allready exists it is much easier to grow that crack. Same with <b>residual stresses</b> in the surface. A stress concentration will make bonds break here first resulting in a crack. But not only residual stresses causes concentrations, the<b> texture</b> and <b>roughness </b>also concentrates forces.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Tensile strength </b>is mostly driven by the <b>microstructure</b> and <b>hardness</b> of the surface.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Contact strength </b>is most often governed by the <b>hardness</b> in datasheets and tables. But factors like residual stresses also play a factor. (For the intressted reader see SS 3147 on different types of damages on gears)<br><br>(Add more)<br><br><br></div>
